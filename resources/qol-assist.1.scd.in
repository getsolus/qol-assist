qol-assist(1)

# NAME

*qol-assist* - Quality of Life Assistance

# SYNOPSIS

*qol-assist* <command> [global-options]

# DESCRIPTION

*qol-assist* is a system level component to assist in migrations within an
operating system, with a specific focus on combatting changes specific to
so-called "rolling release" systems.

*qol-assist* is designed to be an unobtrusive component of the system update
architecture, running versioned system migrations (such as user group inclusion)
over time to keep existing users at feature parity with new installations.

# OPTIONS

*-d*, *--debug*
	Print debug information to the console as the program is running.

# SUBCOMMANDS

*list-users (l) [admin|all|active|system]...*
	Useful utility to gain insight into how the system views different user accounts. This command takes a single
	argument to control how the user list is filtered. This can be useful in debugging to determine which accounts the
	system deems to be administrators, system, or human.

*trigger (t)*
	This subcommand is typically invoked through the update architecture when the *qol-assist* package itself is
	updated. Execution of this subcommand will cause a state tracking file to be created to schedule *qol-assist* to
	start up on the next boot during the early init process.

*migrate (m)*
	This subcommand will only execute if a trigger file has been created through the aforementioned *trigger*
	subcommand. Migrations are idempotent, so all migrations that can be executed will be executed. If a migration is
	seen to have already been applied, it is skipped.

*help (h)*
	Print the supported command set for the *qol-assist*(1) binary.

*version (v)*
	Print the version and license information, before quitting.

# FILES

*qol-assist* tracks state through some special files, and will recover in their absence.

*%TRACKDIR%/trigger*
	If this file exists, *qol-assist migrate* will be started on the next boot during the early init process.

## EXIT STATUS

On exit, 0 is returned.
